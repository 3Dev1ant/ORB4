# Osu! Random Beatmap

The program gives you random beatmaps for the game osu! by generating random numbers. It is not skill-based and it does not do any kind
of calculation: beatmaps found are just totally random. Since it is very simple to create a program like that, we decided to make it at least
good-looking and with many useful function, such as an embedded downloader (ORB!direct).

## Warning

ORB back-end is written in C#, while the front-end uses HTML, CSS3 and Javascript: you can find the source code in the resources directory.
I did this "obfuscation" in order to not make the program files not editable by any one.
