# Osu! Random Beatmap

The program gives you random beatmaps for the game osu! by generating random numbers. It is not skill-based and it does not do any kind
of calculation: beatmaps found are just totally random. Since it is very simple to create a program like that, we decided to make it at least
good-looking and with many useful function, such as an embedded downloader (ORB!direct). The mirror used for beatmap downloader is [Bloodcat](https://bloodcat.com/osu/).
